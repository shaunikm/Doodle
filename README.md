## Model Architecture

The model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed for image classification tasks. It is structured with 3 convolutional blocks followed by fully connected layers. Each block consists of:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Two convolutional layers with 3x3 filters, ReLU activation, and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Batch Normalization**: Applied after each convolutional layer to stabilize and accelerate training.
- **Max Pooling**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, helping to down-sample the input representation.
- **Dropout**: Used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training.

The final layers include:

- **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 2D matrix into a vector.
- **Dense Layers**: A fully connected layer with 512 units and ReLU activation, followed by a dropout layer.
- **Output Layer**: A dense layer with a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class.

The model is compiled with the **Adam optimizer** and uses **sparse categorical cross-entropy** as the loss function, with **accuracy** as the evaluation metric.
